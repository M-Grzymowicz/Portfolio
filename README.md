## About me
Hi, I'm Marcin. I hold a Master of Science and Engineering degree in Management and Production Engineering, with a specialization in Quality Management. Additionally, I have completed postgraduate studies in Logistics and Supply Chain Management as well as Coaching.

I have many years of experience in the industrial sector, particularly in manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation. My interest in working with data began during my university studies. For my master's thesis, I applied Design of Experiments (DoE) methods to improve an assembly process, which involved conducting experiments and analyzing the results in a production facility.

Throughout my professional career, I frequently worked with data using Excel spreadsheets â€” both for analysis and for developing tools to improve the efficiency of departmental operations. Currently, I am eager to deepen my experience with data by pursuing a career in the broad field of data analysis.

Based on the dataset provided on [Kaggle: Banking Customer Churn Prediction Dataset  ](https://www.https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbadole/bank-customer-churn-prediction-dataset) , I developed a classification model to identify customers who are at risk of leaving the bank.
