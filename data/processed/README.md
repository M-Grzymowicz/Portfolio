# Processed Data

This folder is intended to store the processed version of the dataset used in this project.

## Information

Initially, this folder is empty.

Once the preprocessing steps are executed (e.g., by running the appropriate Jupyter Notebook), this folder will be automatically populated with cleaned and transformed data files.

These processed files are used for further analysis and modeling.

> ⚠️ Do not manually add files here. All contents should be generated through the data processing pipeline.
